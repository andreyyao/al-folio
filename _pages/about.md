I am a first year CS PhD student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My interests lie mostly in the theory of programming languages. I like to analyze the behavior of programming languages by considering their **denotational semantics**. I am also interested in designing **type systems** to guarantee desirable properties of languages.

Before starting my PhD, I earned my Bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/).

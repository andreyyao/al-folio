I am a first year CS PhD student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Programming languages is my main area of interest, and I am involved in the [MadPL]() group. My current work resolves around ways of preventing code from being run. No, really, _type systems_ ensures _correct_ and _secure_ code by rejecting large classes of mistakes and attacks. This is especially important when dealing with complex programs, such as _distributed systems_. I also enjoying understanding the behavior of programming languages by considering their _denotational semantics_.

Before starting my PhD, I earned my Bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/).
